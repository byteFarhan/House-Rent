## Features of this project

ğŸš€ On the homepage, I've showcased Houses/Apartments using JSON fake data.

ğŸš€ I've implemented a Apartment details route for each - Apartment displayed. When a user clicks on any specific Apartment "View Property" button, they are directed to the Apartment details route corresponding to their selection.

ğŸš€ In the Apartment details route, users will find comprehensive information about the specific Apartment. Additionally, they have the option to book the Apartment.

ğŸš€ I have implemented an authentication system using Firebase, allowing users to register and log in to their accounts.

ğŸš€ Additionally, I have integrated a feature enabling users to log in with their other social accounts, such as Google and GitHub.

ğŸš€ Furthermore, I have incorporated a private route concept to restrict access to specific routes unless users are logged in to their accounts.
